# 🏥 AI-Powered Healthcare Claim Decision System

An intelligent system that simulates multi-step healthcare insurance claim processing using rule-based reasoning and reinforcement learning concepts.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project models a healthcare claim approval workflow where an AI agent interacts with an environment to resolve claim issues such as:

* Incorrect procedure codes
* Missing documents
* Policy validation
* Claim approval/denial decisions

The system evaluates actions step-by-step and assigns rewards using a grader mechanism.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* ✅ Multi-step decision environment
* ✅ Rule-based AI agent
* ✅ Reward system integrated with grader
* ✅ Supports Easy, Medium, Hard tasks
* ✅ REST API using Flask
* ✅ Structured inference logging
* ✅ Dockerized for deployment

## ⚙️ Installation

### 🔹 Local Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd healthcare-claim

pip install -r requirements.txt
python server/app.py
```

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### 🔹 1. Reset Environment (POST)

```
POST /reset
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "task_level": "easy"
}
```

---

### 🔹 2. Get Current State (GET)

```
GET /state
```

---

### 🔹 3. Take Action (POST)

```
POST /step
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "action_type": "correct_code",
  "new_code": "PROC123",
  "justification": "Correct billing code"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Running Inference

```bash
python inference.py
```

### Output Example

```
[START]
task: easy
[STEP]
{"step": 0, "action": "correct_code", "reward": 0.83}
[STEP]
{"step": 1, "action": "add_document", "reward": 0.11}
[END]
final_score: 0.94
```

---
